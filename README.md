# Towards Understanding the Similarity of Learning Representations Via the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

by Shuchen Li, Chang Wang, Pengyun Yue

This is our project of the Machine Learning course, 2020 spring. Our code is based on [What's hidden in a randomly weighted neural network?](https://github.com/allenai/hidden-networks) by Vivek Ramanujan and Mitchell Wortsman. We computed some similarity metrics on the sub-networks.
